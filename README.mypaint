Building and installing on Linux
================================

Update submodules

    $ git submodule update --init

Compile and run:

    $ scons
    $ ./mypaint

Install:

    # scons prefix=/usr/local install

Uninstall:

    # scons prefix=/usr/local install --clean

Install (for packagers):

    $ scons prefix=/usr --install-sandbox=`pwd`/path/to/sandbox

        (NOTE: the sandbox location must be located under the current working
        directory, and be specified as an *absolute* path. Using `pwd` or your
        build environment's absolute path-to-here variable should achieve that.
        The above installs the main launch script (for example) as
        "./path/to/sandbox/usr/bin/mypaint".  Use a symlink if that's too
        limiting.)


Required: pygobject, gtk3, python(=2.7), swig, numpy, pycairo(>=1.4), libpng,
            lcms2, json-c, librsvg
    (NOTE: pygobject must be built with --enable-cairo)


Debian users can fetch these dependencies by running:

    # apt-get install g++ python-dev python-numpy \ 
        libgtk-3-dev python-gi-dev gir1.2-gtk-3.0 python-gi-cairo \ 
        swig scons gettext libpng12-dev liblcms2-dev libjson0-dev

Recommended: a pressure sensitive input device (graphic tablet)


Post-installation
=================

Runtime linker
--------------

You may need to update ld.so's caches and links after installation on some
systems. As root,

    # ldconfig

Do this if you get any messages about MyPaint not being able to load
mypaintlib.so when run on the command line.

If you installed to a $prefix other than the trusted locations, /usr/lib and
/lib, you may need to add a line for it into /etc/ld.so.conf or ld.so.conf.d
before running ldconfig. Scons won't do this for you because the need to
perform the action varies by distribution, and package distributers need to be
able to defer it to post-installation scripting.


Icon theme caches
-----------------

Take care to update the icon theme cache for your $prefix if you're installing
mypaint to a location which has one of these files already. If you install new
icons, any existing icon cache must be updated too, otherwise MyPaint won't be
able to find its icons even if it looks in the right place. For example for an
install into /usr (which has one on most systems), you should run

    $ gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor
    $ chmod a+r /usr/share/icons/hicolor/icon-theme.cache

after installation to ensure that the cache is up to date. Scons won't do this
for you because the cache file is optional.

If you install to /usr/local, you may need to run this instead:

    $ gtk-update-icon-cache --ignore-theme-index /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor
